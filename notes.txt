INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS 

Clone https://github.com/ehk9000/url-shortener.git repo to your terminal 

Cd into url-shortener directory 

Run make setup in terminal 

make setup utilizes the included MakeFile to compose a docker container that instantiates a MongoDb database at port 27017. 

It then runs the server-setup script, which installs all packages for both the frontend and the backend servers at the same time.

npm start or make server will spin up both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously. The frontend server is run on http://localhost:3000/ and backend server is run on http://localhost:8080/


npm test or make test will run the server-side tests using Jest
